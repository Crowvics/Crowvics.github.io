title: MITRE Frameworks Overview
---

An overview of the main **MITRE frameworks and tools** used in cybersecurity for threat detection, analysis, and defense.

---

## MITRE ATT&CK®

</p>

A **knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques** based on real-world observations.

* Maps **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** of threat groups  
* Covers multiple platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, and cloud  
* Supports both **defensive (blue team)** and **offensive (red team)** activities  
* Includes the **ATT&CK® Navigator** for visualization and planning  

---

## Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR)
A **repository of analytics linked to ATT&CK® techniques**.

* Provides **pseudocode and queries** for detection in tools like Splunk or EQL  
* Offers **validated and well-explained analytics**, including operational context  
* Complements ATT&CK® by providing actionable **detection methods**  

---

## MITRE ENGAGE
A framework for **adversary engagement operations**.

* Implements **Cyber Denial** (blocking adversary actions) and **Cyber Deception** (planting misleading artifacts)  
* Organizes operations through the **Engage Matrix**: Prepare → Expose → Affect → Elicit → Understand  
* Complements ATT&CK® by enabling **active defense and intelligence gathering**  

---

## MITRE D3FEND
A **knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures**.

* Focused on **detection, denial, and disruption** techniques  
* Provides definitions, implementation guidance, and considerations  
* Enhances defensive planning alongside ATT&CK® analytics  

---

## ATT&CK® Emulation Plans
A **library of adversary emulation scenarios**.

* Guides simulation of attacks from known threat groups (e.g., APT3, APT29, FIN6)  
* Supports **blue/red team exercises** and **testing defensive readiness**
