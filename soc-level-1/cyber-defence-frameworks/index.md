# Cyber Defence Frameworks

This section introduces key cybersecurity frameworks and models used to understand, detect, and mitigate adversary behavior. Each subtopic provides a different perspective on how analysts and organizations can approach cyber defense.

---

## Junior Security Analyst Intro
Focuses on concepts related to the role and daily activities, highlighting monitoring, triage, and incident escalation within a SOC.

---

## Pyramid of Pain
Explores how different types of indicators—file hashes, IPs, domains, host and network artifacts, and attacker tools or techniques—impact the effort required for adversaries to adapt, helping to guide detection and response priorities.

---

## Cyber Kill Chain
Covers the stages of a network intrusion, from reconnaissance to actions on objectives, and shows how understanding each phase supports detection, prevention, and defense strategies.

---

## Unified Kill Chain
A detailed attack framework that complements traditional kill chain models, emphasizing all stages from reconnaissance to data exfiltration and attacker motivation, and highlighting how real-world attacks often revisit earlier phases.

---

## Diamond Model
Covers the core elements of the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, emphasizing the relationships between adversary, infrastructure, capability, and victim to support intrusion understanding and threat assessment.

---

## [MITRE](./cyber-defence-frameworks/mitre.md)
Resources provided by **MITRE** for understanding adversary behavior and building cybersecurity defenses.

---

## [Summit](./summit.md)
Simulates tracking an adversary through detection and defense exercises, using the Pyramid of Pain to increase the effort required for attackers to succeed.

---

## Eviction
A scenario-based exercise simulating the detection and mitigation of an advanced persistent threat, emphasizing the analysis of adversary techniques and attack behavior.
