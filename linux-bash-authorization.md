title: Linux commands in the Bash shell â€“ Manage Authorization
---

In this lab, I practiced using Linux commands to manage file and directory permissions. The goal was to check and adjust authorization settings in the `/home/researcher2/projects` directory, making sure only the right users and groups had access.

### Tasks included
- Check file and directory details
- Change file permissions
- Change file permissions on a hidden file
- Change directory permissions
